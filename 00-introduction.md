# Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that's known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python is widely used for a variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

One of the key features of Python is its syntax, which is designed to be easy to read and write. Python code is typically more concise and readable than code in other programming languages, which makes it a great choice for beginners who are just getting started with programming.

Python is also an interpreted language, which means that you don't need to compile your code before running it. Instead, you can simply write your code and run it using a Python interpreter, which is available for a variety of operating systems.

Python is an open-source language, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. There's a large and active community of Python developers who share their knowledge and expertise through online forums, tutorials, and documentation.

If you're new to programming, Python is a great language to start with. Its ease of use, versatility, and popularity make it a valuable skill to have in a variety of industries and fields. In the next lessons, we'll cover the basics of Python programming, starting with variables and data types.

So, let's get started, see you in the next lesson.
