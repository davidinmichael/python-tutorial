# In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
# Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces, making
# your code more organized, readable, and reusable.

# Creating a Function
# You can create a function in Python using the def keyword followed by the function
# name and parentheses containing any parameters the function takes. The function body is
# indented below the def statement.
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling a Function
# To call a function, simply use the function name followed by parentheses and
# provide any necessary arguments.
greet("Alice")
