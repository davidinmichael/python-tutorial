# PEP 8 Style Guide and Code Formatting
# PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. Following PEP 8 helps improve code readability
# and consistency across projects. Some key points from PEP 8 include:

# Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
# Limit line length to 79 characters for readability.
# Use meaningful variable and function names.
# Use lowercase letters for variable names and lowercase with underscores for function names (snake_case).
# Use spaces around operators and after commas.
# Use spaces after commas in function arguments.
# Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and logical sections of code.
# Follow consistent naming conventions for classes, functions, and variables.
# Code Documentation and Docstrings
# Good code documentation is essential for understanding code functionality and usage.
# Python supports docstrings, which are string literals that appear right after
# the definition of a class, function, or module. Docstrings should provide information
# about the purpose, usage, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised by the code.

# Example of a function with a docstring:

def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers and return the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b


# Code Optimization and Performance Tuning
# Optimizing Python code involves improving its efficiency, speed, and resource usage.
# Some techniques for code optimization and performance tuning include:

# Use built-in functions and libraries for common operations instead of writing custom code.
# Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for efficient iteration and data processing.
# Avoid unnecessary variable creation and data copying.
# Use efficient data structures, such as dictionaries for fast lookups and sets for membership tests.
# Use appropriate algorithms and data structures for specific tasks, such as sorting and searching.
# Profile your code using tools like cProfile or timeit to identify performance
# bottlenecks and optimize critical sections.


# Conclusion
# Following Python best practices, such as adhering to the PEP 8 style guide, writing clear
# and informative documentation with docstrings, and optimizing code for performance,
# can improve code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. These practices help
# ensure that your code is clean, understandable, and performs well, contributing to a
# better development experience and quality software.
