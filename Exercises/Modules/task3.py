# Write a program that defines a function called calculate_distance that takes two sets
# of coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as arguments and calculates the Euclidean distance
# between them using the math module. Then, ask the user to input the coordinates of two
# points and print the distance between them.

# Write your program below
